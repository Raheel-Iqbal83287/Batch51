I like pizza with the sides filled with kebabs, sausages, vegetables, heavily filled with cheese. Pizzas that immerses me in falvours. The pizzas I like are the ones that takes me on the journey of pleasure, satisfaction and being alive. I like pizza the most when it is hot with cheese melting all aroudn. I really love pizza!")
